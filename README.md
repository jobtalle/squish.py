A web app compressor utility.

This works by inlining source files referenced by an HTML page. It currently inlines and compresses the following sources:

* CSS
* Javascript
* GLSL shaders (found as strings inside javascript)

This is a tool I use personally; it works for my coding style, but it may be incompatible with others.
